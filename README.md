Contributing to RF & Microwave, based Python applications. These applications are just regular daily tasking application in the RF field such as Swapping S2P files, Adding or substracting dB values from a given S2P file, and many more.
Working mainly with scikit-rf Python packages here for RF-related tasks.
Numpy, Pandas for data manipulation, such as S-parameter manipulation.
Matplotlib for plotting and visualizing the data, as S-parameters.
Pyvisa, which can be used to control the automation of instruments with GPIB, USB, and VISA interfaces.
